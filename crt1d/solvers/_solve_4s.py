    Notes
    -----
    All eq./p. references in the code are to Tian et al. 2007 (:cite:`tian_four-stream_2007`)
    unless otherwise noted.

    Note that the authors use :math:`I` for radiance, and :math:`F` for irradiance.
    To be consistent with the other model codes, I am using

    * ``I`` for irradiance

    * ``R`` for radiance

    * ``F`` for actinic flux


    `mu_s` (:math:`\mu_s`) is the cosine of the dividing angle for the two beams:

    .. math::
       \mu_s = \cos(\theta_s)

    :math:`\mu_s` divides each hemisphere into two sectors:
    :math:`[0, \mu_s]` and :math:`[\mu_s, 1]` for the upward
    and :math:`[-1, -\mu_s]` and :math:`[-\mu_s, 0]` for the downward.

    Potential values for the `mu_s` "hyperparameter":

    * 0.501: value suggested by the authors (~ 60 deg., arccos(0.501)*180/pi = 59.93)

    * 0.33998, 0.86114: Gaussâ€“Legendre quadrature points for n=4, ~ 70 deg., ~ 31 deg.
      Tian et al. (2007) and Li and Dobbie (1998) find (0.33998) the former to give more accurate results.
